- We need to use `https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation` and build a crypto currency price tracker
- we should be able to list multiple currencies and their price on the home page
- Search functionality to search for a currency
- If we click on a currency, then we should see the details of it and it's price history based on hours, days and years.
- Support USD and INR pricing for listing
